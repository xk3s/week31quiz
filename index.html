<h2>My Favorite part of Advance Web</h2> 
<p>My favorite part of Patino is when we get to hang out with are friend.  
In Patino mostly everyone knows each other in the school because this school is small.  
Patino is also a great school with everyone just helping each other trying to get things done as fast as possible.</p> 
<h2>My least favorite part of Advance Web</h2> 
<p>Mt least favorite part about Patino is the lunch that they give us. 
I also don't like how there isn't really anything to do out at lunch.  
I also don't like how this year (2018-2019) that we didn't go on a fieldtrip to anywhere far.</p>
